Ethernet Mod Nmap Recon Payload

Author: Hackazillarex
Version: 2.0
Category: Fast Network Reconnaissance
Platform: Hak5 devices / Linux (Bash)
Interface: USB Ethernet (Glitch Mod / non‑GMO compatible)

📌 Overview

The Ethernet Mod Nmap Recon Payload is a speed‑optimized reconnaissance script designed to quickly profile a wired network using a USB Ethernet adapter.

The payload performs:

Automatic Ethernet interface bring‑up via DHCP

Local network discovery

Identification of the gateway and up to 4 additional live hosts

A single‑pass, high‑speed Nmap scan of the top 10 TCP ports

Clean, per‑host output written to a timestamped loot file

The focus is speed over depth, making it ideal for quick situational awareness during initial access or drop‑and‑run operations.

⚡ Features

🚀 Fast recon using aggressive Nmap timing

🔌 USB Ethernet adapter detection and validation

🌐 Gateway + 5 total hosts (gateway + 4 LAN devices)

📊 Top 10 TCP ports per host

🧠 Single Nmap scan for minimal execution time

🗂 Structured loot output

👁 Optional automatic log viewer launch

💡 Compatible with non‑GMO / Glitch Mod environments
